# IPL Winning Team Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the probability of an IPL (Indian Premier League) team's victory during a match. By analyzing historical data and key match parameters, the model provides real-time predictions, helping users gain insights into the likely outcomes of ongoing games.

# Key Features
**Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes logistic regression to predict the probability of a team's victory based on real-time match data.

**Data-Driven Analysis:** The model is trained on historical IPL match data, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.

**Comprehensive Parameters:** Considers essential match factors, including:Batting team, Bowling team, Arena (venue), Total runs scored, Current score, Current over, Wickets left.

**Real-Time Predictions:** Provides the probability of winning for both teams as the match progresses.

**Streamlit Integration:** The user interface is built using Streamlit, making the web app interactive, easy to use, and accessible.

# Technologies Used
**Python:** For building the machine learning model.

**Scikit-learn:** To implement the logistic regression algorithm.

**Pandas and NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**Streamlit:** To create a user-friendly web interface.

**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data and predictions.
